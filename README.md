Bug Crossing - A clone of the classic arcade game Frogger


This project is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nano Degree program. Most of my work is in the app.js file. All images and the game engine were provide by Udacity.


The objective of this game is to cross the road without colliding with a bug. There is a 60 second timer. Every crossing adds points. Picking up gems also adds points. Use the arrow keys to move the player.
